# Regulars__and_finite_automatons
The program implements the following:
1) Building a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) by a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA).
2) Construction by DKA of a complete DKA (Ð¡DKA).
3) Construction according to DKA of a regular expression defining the same language.
4) Construction by DKA of a regular expression defining the negation of the language.
